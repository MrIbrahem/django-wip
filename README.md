**FairVillage - Website Internationalisation Platform**

*FairVillage WIP* (WIP = Website Internationalisation Platform) is an Editorial Desk for the Internationalisation (i18n) of websites; it has been developed inside *FairVillage*, a sub-project of the *FI-Adopt* valorization project of the *FI-WARE* EU Programme.

WIP is an original application of the *Translation Proxy* concept: an approach to the translation of a web site that operates
from outside, by intercepting the request for a web page and serving to the user a page containing translated content. In the translation proxy approach, contents aren't translated at sight, as with GoogleTranslate; rather, fragments of the web page are replaced in real-time with translations that have been prepared offline and revised in context. Obviously, some caching can be applied to improve performance.

Since the background work involved in setting up a proxy site of high quality is critical, WIP aims to support it at a high extent. Learning mechanisms and knowledge reuse are exploited to make the translation and revision tasks more and more productive and to minimize the maintenance-related tasks.

On the server side, WIP integrates the Django web application framework and many Python libraries, such as:
[*NLTK*](https://github.com/nltk/nltk) and [*Scrapy*](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy). On the client side, WIP builds on Javascript libraries, such as jQuery, and on the Chrome plugin technology.

WIP can interface web services providing linguistic resources; for example:
- Translation Memories (TM), like MyMemory, and
- Machine Translation (MT) services, like GoogleTranslate

Currently we are experimenting
- [*Lineardoc*](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-services-cxserver/tree/master/lib/lineardoc), a library by MediaWiki for "translating HTML content using plain text supporting MT engine"; we have converted it from Javascript to Python 3
- [*eflomal*](https://github.com/robertostling/eflomal), an advanced algorithm by Robert Ã–stling for word-level aligning of the source and the translated sentences; we are trying to extend it to exploit human supervision.


WIP includes a lot of algorithms and language resources that make it also an ideal tool for research and education in many language-related fields, such as text analysis, web mining, translation and language learning.

The production version of *FairVillage WIP* runs on Linux-Ubuntu, in a cloud architecture based on the [FI-Lab](https://www.fiware.org/lab/), but we are performing most of the development on Windows.
