**FairVillage - Website Internationalisation Platform**

*FairVillage WIP* (WIP = Website Internationalisation Platform) is an Editorial Desk for the Internationalisation (i18n) of websites; it is being developed inside [*FairVillage*](http://fiadopt-project.eu/2015/10/startup-spotlight-fairvillage/), a sub-project of the *FI-Adopt* valorization project of the *FI-WARE* EU Programme. 

On the server side, WIP will integrate Python libraries, such as Scrapy, web services providing Translation Memories (TM) and Machine Translation (MT), and possibly other integrated platforms, such as SWeTE, through REST APIs.

On the client side, WIP will build on Javascript libraries, such as jQuery, and on plugin technologies available for FireFox and Chrome.

The production version of *FairVillage WIP* runs on Linux-Ubuntu, in a cloud architecture based on the [FI-Lab](https://www.fiware.org/lab/), but we are performing some of the development on Windows, using *django-wip* as a Django *starter project*.
